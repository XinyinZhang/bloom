  2. Countdown timer
  3. Cancel button: by pressing cancel button, a dialog box will pop up asking if the user wants to cancel the timer. If user       click yes, a withered flower will be added to the garden.
  4. Break button: Once the user activates the timer, a break button will be available allowing for the user to take a break for a period of 5 minutes before resuming the countdown. User can feel free to leave the app during this period, and the flower will not be killed. However, if the user is away from Bloom after break is over, the flower is killed.
